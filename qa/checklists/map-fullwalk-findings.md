# Doc A — Map full-walk playtest findings (round 3, main a90071b)

Rules: APPEND ONLY to the end of this file. Do NOT read the existing entries before appending; write your own findings blind.
Each finding: `- [tester] [ID] location (x,y,z) | what happened | repro | severity`.
When you're done appending, open Doc B (`map-fullwalk-signoff.md`) and sign it.

## MAP-QA-3 — Stairs, Ramps & Vertical

- Date: 2026-11-03 · Round 3 · tested against main @ 91ea2d1 · Godot 4.7 headless, fresh clone, `godot --headless --import` run once first
- Method: real simulated input only. All keys (W/Shift/Space and E for doors) are real InputEventKey events sent through Input.parse_input_event (the scene's `_qa_key`), never Input.action_press. Mouse yaw uses InputEventMouseMotion. Long outdoor legs follow NavigationServer3D path points as steering targets. Throwaway SceneTree drivers in /tmp, outside the repo, run with `-- --qa-placement`. No position writes and no repo .gd/.tscn/.py edits.
- Built-in modes: `--qa-stairs` **PASS** (`DONE failures=0`); `--qa-egress` **PASS** (`DONE failures=0`).

| # | Location | Repro | Severity | Result |
|---|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Stair core head L2 (1.15, 0.0) → F1 | (Round 2 Medium recheck) Hold W toward the F1 foot (1.15,-8.15) and tap Space every ~0.3 s. Unchanged: the player is thrown east to x≈3.65, pinned on `RevC_Shell_L2_col` ~3 s, then crosses all of F1 airborne at y≈4.1–5.3 (L2 height) and drops onto the landing (y 2.465). 298 frames vs ~92 walking. | Medium | FAIL (not fixed) |
| 2 | Tram kerb ramp top edge ≈ (9.4, -15.5) | (Round 2 Medium recheck) From the platform (12,-16.7) walk W/NW toward the paving (7.5,-15.0). Unchanged: y goes 0.351→0.305, then the player stops dead at (9.41,-15.47) y=0.305, on the floor with W held, for the rest of the 120-frame window. Never steps down to the paving (0.05). Walking up along the egress line still works. | Medium | FAIL (not fixed) |
| 3 | Stair core F1/F2 jump sweep | Jump-spam down F1/F2 and up F2/F1: all settle in band (landing 2.465, L1 0.00, L2 4.08). Up F1 arrives airborne and lands in 23 frames (normal arc). | — | PASS |
| 4 | Mid-flight F2 (-1.15,-5.0) | Stop on the ramp (y=1.048, on floor), turn 180° with the mouse, walk down to L1. No slide or snag. | — | PASS |
| 5 | Landings (±1.15,-8.15) | Standing jump dy=-0.001; crossing the landing both ways. | — | PASS |
| 6 | F1 sprint | Shift+W down/up F1 settles at 2.465 / 4.080. | — | PASS |
| 7 | Tram platform kerb front edge (z=-17.55) | Walk S past the kerb line: the surface continues at y 0.35 with no drop; walk back N onto the platform cleanly. | Info | PASS |
| 8 | Curb row `ext_curb_segment_21..23` (z≈19.35, x≈-10) | Walk N over it, walk S back, jump-cross N: all clean (curb top 0.15). | — | PASS |
| 9 | Egress route exterior paving + `--qa-egress` path | All in band. | — | PASS |

Totals: 0 Critical, 0 High, 2 Medium, 0 Low, 1 Info; 7 PASS, 2 FAIL.
